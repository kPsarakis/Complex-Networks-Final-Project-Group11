The main task of this project is the analysis of the co-purchasing behaviour of Amazon users. In particular, this is done by creating a network of Amazon products where the edges connect products that have been co-purchased. The assumption made in this case is that more product reviews correspond to more product purchases. Therefore, we further evaluated the network to reason about the most influential products and whether the review distribution can be approximated via our proposed network.
